# Regelhulpify

## What is Regelhulpify
The word 'Regelhulpify' is derived from the Dutch word 'rule aid', a tool that helps personalise laws, rules and guidelines. The Regelhulpify app allows anyone to make an account and start creating such a tool. In practice, a Regelhulp is a bit like a quiz, but without wrong or right answers: the logic one attaches to the answers makes sure the end user gets personalized information.

## How Regelhulpify was built
As per the requirements, I've built the app in a combination of Django and JavaScript, trying to explore as many functionalities as possible from both.
